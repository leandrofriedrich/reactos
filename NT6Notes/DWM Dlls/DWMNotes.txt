Current Status of DWM:
Non existent other than a stub.
however copying over DWM from vista leads to some interesting results;

dwmapi,
udwm,
milcore,
dwmredir,
slcc,
slwga,
DWM.exe,

Will at the current status of this branch start execution of DWM as a service.
However nevertheless we are held back by user32 for going much further as it crashes soon after.
