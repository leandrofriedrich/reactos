This entire branch in general is sort of a proof of concept, combined with a notebook
Inside this branch as i add to it is eventually going to be every note or prototype function
written for NT6 stuff. 

The file hierarchy is meant to match ROS but everything in this folder is NT6+ based notes;
i.e:
    drivers/usb/usbxhci/xhcinotes.txt
Current Status:
    -Missing 90% of physically written notes
    -Missing Functions i have previously written in another branch
    -Not building MSVC still
Eventually i will start adding to new features and notes, but i'm waiting on these two things fixed
first.

Thank you for taking the time to mess with my silly expierments 
-The_DarkFire_

and finally, thank you Getequ and Oleg for the base the inspired me to 
do this crazy experiment.
